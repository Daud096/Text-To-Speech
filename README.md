Introduction 
The Text-to-Speech (TTS) application is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool developed using the 
Tkinter library in Python. Its purpose is to convert written text into spoken words. The application 
allows users to enter text in a text field, select a preferred voice and language, adjust the speed of speech, 
and perform actions such as converting the text to speech, saving it as an audio file, clearing the text 
field, and exiting the application.
